# FK170124_Qiime-18S
Analysis of 18S rRNA sequence data generated from the FK170124 research cruise

	-Commands in file "FK170124_18S_Qiime_commands.txt" were run sequentially on the command-line interface of qiime2.
	
	-18S sequence data can be downloaded from the NCBI repository under accession number PRJNA494700. 
	
	-All ".qza" and ".qzv" files  are intermediary files for each Qiime2 data processing step after initial input of DNA sequence data.
	
	-Jupyter Notebook FK170124_18S_analysis_github.ipynb shows how data were further analyzed. Files required for this analysis are provided as ".csv" format
